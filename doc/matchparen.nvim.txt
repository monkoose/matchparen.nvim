INTRODUCTION                                    *matchparen.nvim-introduction*

CONFIGURATION                                  *matchparen.nvim-configuration*

To configure the plugin you need to setup it inside init.vim >
    lua <<EOF
        require('matchparen').setup()
    EOF

or inside init.lua >
    require('matchparen').setup()

`setup()` function accepts table with following keys
    `on_startup`~
        Boolean.
        If `true` the plugin will highlight brackets on neovim startup.
    `hl_group`~
        String.
        Highlight group of the matched brackets.
    `augroup_name`~
        String.
        Name for augroup that created by the plugin. In most situations
        you don't need to change it, only if for some reason you already
        have augroup with the same name, to prevent it deleted by the plugin.
    `debounce_time`~
        Positive integer or nil.
        Debounce time in milliseconds for rehighlighting of brackets.
        In theory this option should improve responsiveness of the editor in
        some seldom situations and remove rehighlighting of the same brackets
        multiple times because of intersection of the autocommands.
        If you want to completely disable debouncing and rehighlight brackets
        instantly set it's value to `nil`.

Defaults are >
    require('matchparen').setup({
        on_startup = true,
        hl_group = 'MatchParen',
        augroup_name = 'matchparen',
        debounce_time = 60,
    })
